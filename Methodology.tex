In order to gather all relevant articles needed to perform this state-of-the-art review, a systematic approach was used (figure \ref{fig:prisma}).

First, 10 articles were hand-picked that were identified as relevant to the subject. These hand-picked articles served as a baseline for the upcoming search in online libraries.
A systematic search on Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify all articles aimed at the detection of mind wandering. The retrieved articles were checked on relevancy and completeness.
An indication on the completeness of the search terms was obtained by comparing the results of the online libraries with the baseline. 
The used search terms were tweaked by making them broader when the results did not contain a lot of the baseline articles, and made narrower when there were many irrelavant articles retrieved.
*A logbook of the used search terms can be found in appendix A.*
As a result of this first step an initial list of 129 articles was obtained.

Second, all duplicates obtained from the different libraries were removed, leaving 72 articles.
Third, from here on after, the articles were divided into two stacks, each containing 36 articles. 
The stacks were peer reviewed on their title. This resulted in three exclusion criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Not related to Mind Wandering}, e.g. \cite{ISI:000432512400017}, focussus on different formats to present lecture material and is therefore excluded.
    \item \textbf{Related to the impact of Mind Wandering}, e.g. \cite{Albert2018LinkingDrivers}, links mind wandering while driving to dangerous behaviour behind the wheel and is thus excluded.
    \item \textbf{Related to attention guidance}, e.g. \cite{Xiao2018ClassroomMechanism}, explores gamification to restore students' attention level in classroom teaching and is thus excluded.
  \end{enumerate}
In case of uncertainty, articles were included to be screened on abstract.
8 articles were excluded while screening on abstract, leaving 23 articles remaining. 
The excluded articles fit the earlier defined exclusion criteria but looked interesting based on the title.

Finally, every remaining article was peer reviewed on their full-text. This included reading the methodology, results, conclusion and inspecting their figures and tables.
Two papers were excluded because they give an overview of the subject, rather than explaining (new) methods of detecting mind wandering. 
Another two articles were excluded since they didn't automatically detect mind wandering, bur rather uses manual (self-)reporting exclusivly.
At last, one article was excluded because it describes a system that uses third party detection mechanisms of mind wandering. The focus of this article lays on implementing this system in a learning environment, rather than on combining/improving detection methods for mind wandering.
The final result is a total of 18 articles to be included in the review.
