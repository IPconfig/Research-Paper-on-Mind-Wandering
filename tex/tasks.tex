Table \ref{tab:data} shows a variety of different tasks that the participants had to perform, each with different advantages related to that study. The two most used tasks were reading a text and watching some type of content on a computer screen. These two methods are probably the most popular because they are easy to distribute to a large audience and do not require any advanced equipment. Other than these two tasks, none of them occurred more than once, because the others were usually specific to a certain study, such as interacting with learning software \cite{Hutt2017OutClassroom}. An interesting thing to note here is that the type of performed tasks did not seem to correlate with the modalities that were used. This can be seen in Table \ref{tab:data}, the task of watching something on a computer screen was evaluated in studies that recorded the modalities of eye gaze \cite{Zhao2017ScalableApproach}, EEG brain activity \cite{Russell2016MonitoringEnvironments}, facial features \cite{Stewart2017FaceComprehension} and heart rate \cite{Pham2015Attentivelearner:Tracking}. This suggests that MW can be automatically detected in a wide variety of ways within the same context, thus making the technology very flexible in terms of implementation.
