In order to identify all studies that may be deemed relevant, a highly systematic approach was used that can be broken down into six steps (Fig. \ref{fig:prisma}).

First, 10 studies were hand-picked that were identified as relevant for our goal. These hand-picked studies served as a baseline for the upcoming search of online libraries.
A systematic search on Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify all studies aimed at the detection of mind wandering. The retrieved studies were checked on relevancy and completeness.
An indication of the completeness of the search terms used was obtained by comparing the results of the online libraries with the baseline. 
The used search terms were tweaked by making them broader when the results contained a low number of studies and few baseline studies and made narrower when there were many irrelevant studies retrieved.
A logbook of the used search terms can be found in Appendix A.
As a result of this first step, an initial list of 125 studies was obtained.

Second, all duplicates obtained from the different libraries were removed, leaving 72 studies.

Third, from this point onward, all remaining studies were divided into two stacks. Each stack was reviewed individually by two team members.
The studies were screened on their title and were excluded if team members reached consensus on their irrelevancy. 
This resulted in three exclusion criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Not related to Mind Wandering}, e.g. \cite{ISI:000432512400017}, focuses on different formats to present lecture material and is therefore excluded.
  \item \textbf{Related to the impact of Mind Wandering}, e.g. \cite{Albert2018LinkingDrivers}, concludes that mind wandering while driving leads to dangerous behaviour behind the wheel and is thus excluded.
  \item \textbf{Related to attention guidance}, e.g. \cite{Xiao2018ClassroomMechanism}, explores gamification to restore students' attention level in classroom teaching and is thus excluded.  \end{enumerate}
In case of uncertainty, studies were included to be screened on abstract. This step narrowed the list of studies down to 31.

Fourth, Eight studies were excluded while screening on abstract, leaving 23 studies remaining. 
The excluded studies fit the earlier defined exclusion criteria but looked interesting based on their title.

Fifth, every remaining article was accessed and screened on their full-text. This included reading the methodology, results, conclusion and inspecting their figures and tables.
Two papers were excluded because they give an overview of the field, rather than explaining (new) methods of detecting mind wandering. 
Another two studies were excluded because they use manual reporting exclusively.

At last, one article was excluded because it describes a system that uses third-party solutions to detect mind wandering. The focus of this article lays on implementing this system in a learning environment, rather than on combining/improving detection methods for mind wandering.
In conclusion, a total of 18 studies are left to review.

Finally, the studies were carefully studied, extracting relevant data. This data is then further analyzed.
