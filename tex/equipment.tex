The same modalities can sometimes be captured using different sensors. Eye gaze, for example, is often measured using an eye tracker. Eye trackers are often expensive. This is not always the case however, in \cite{Hutt2017OutClassroom} for example, a commercial off the shelf eye tracker is used. In order to make the automatic detection of MW more widely available it was also studied whether this could be done using a low-end webcam \cite{Stewart2017FaceComprehension}\cite{Stewart2016WheresViewing}\cite{Zhao2017ScalableApproach}, or using the camera of a mobile device \cite{ISI:000443429900018}. Another example is the heart rate. In \cite{Gontier2016HowEnvironment}, the heart rate is measured using an ECG sensor, while this is also done using the cameras of a mobile phone \cite{Pham2015Attentivelearner:Tracking}. There are however also modalities that were always recorded using the same type of device. For example, physiology was always measured using a wrist sensor. The fact that it is being studied whether different types of devices can detect MW shows that the researchers are aware of the impact of the types of sensors used on the applications of the detection of MW.
