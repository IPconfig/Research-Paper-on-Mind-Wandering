The same modalities can sometimes be captured using different sensors. Eye gaze, for example, is often measured using an eye tracker. Eye trackers are often expensive, in \cite{Hutt2017OutClassroom}, a commercial off the shelf eye tracker is used. In order to make the automatic detection of MW more widely available it was also studied whether this could be done using a low-end webcam \cite{Stewart2017FaceComprehension}\cite{Stewart2016WheresViewing}\cite{Zhao2017ScalableApproach}, or using the camera of a mobile device \cite{ISI:000443429900018}. Another example is heart rate. In \cite{Gontier2016HowEnvironment}, heart rate is measured using an ECG sensor, while this is also done using the cameras of a mobile phone \cite{Pham2015Attentivelearner:Tracking}. There are however also modalities that were always recorded using the same type of device, e.g., physiology was always measured using a wrist sensor. The fact that it is being studied whether different types of devices are able to detect MW shows that the researchers are aware of the impact of the type of equipment on the applications of the detection of MW.
