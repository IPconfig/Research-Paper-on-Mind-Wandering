While reviewing the literature it was also questioned whether there are any published datasets for research concerning the automatic detection of MW. It was chosen to leave this column out of the table, since none of the reviewed literature mentioned a published dataset or published their own dataset. Publishing datasets could be beneficial for the research in general. By publishing data other people could research different approaches of detecting MW without having to collect the data themselves. The data could also be used to validate the research that already has been done. Publishing datasets would also make it easier to test whether a certain ML algorithm that has not been tried in the study itself would result in a better model.
